If you are having issues with PIP not installing stuff on your mac without homebrew, try --ignore-installed as an option on it.

I do not tend to use dedicated modules such as git or file because the commands I would like to run are shorter than repeated slightly varied tasks.

For redirects that aren't www related, (i.e. something.com to example.com) I prefer to keep those in the registrars configuration.
